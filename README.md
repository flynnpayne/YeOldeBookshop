Assignment for BCIT141 Website Development as part of the Diploma of Website Development and Design at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

For this assignment I had to design and create a website for an imaginary client, which required a specification document, website designs, the completed website, and any change request forms.

The specifications document covered:
Client Details,
Goals and Objectives,
Target Audience,
Website Structure,
Website Content,
User Interaction,
Designs (including narrow and widescreen designs),
SEO,
Domain Name and Hosting recommendations,
Copyright,
and Budget.

I got a mark of 89.4% for this assignment which helped me to get an A+ for the class overall.
