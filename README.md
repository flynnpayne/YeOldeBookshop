Assignment for BCIT141 Website Development

This project was for an assignment as part of my study at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

I had to design and create a website for an imaginary client, which required a specification document, website designs, the completed website, and any change request forms. 

The specifications document covered: 
Client Details, 
Goals and Objectives, 
Target Audience, 
Website Structure, 
Website Content, 
User Interaction, 
Designs (including narrow and widescreen designs), 
SEO, 
Domain Name and Hosting recommendations, 
Copyright,
and Budget.

I got a mark of 89.4% for this assignment which helped me to get an A+ for the class overall.
